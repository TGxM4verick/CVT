# General Overview
This folder contains all the tuning data used to tune a CVtech CVT.  I used several articles and Books to put together the spreadsheets. In order to adapt this tuning data the user needs to find out the spring force of availablel springs or can use a solver to find the desired spring force.
These spreadsheets will provide a baseline for most CVTs however adaptaion for each user is encouraged.  Adding more tuning data and spreadsheets to the project in encouraged.
